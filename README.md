# My-first-GAN
The goal was to build an SRGAN able to upscale the resolution of pictures

I helped myself with the git from python_for_microscopists and with the help of my engineering courses.
My aim was to understand the concept of SRGANs and make it works with python.

Here is an exemple with only 10 epochs ! (left is the low resolution pictures, right is the high resolution pictures and in the middle is the left picture proccesed by our SRGAN)
